# Path Forward

# Goals
- Create AWS account and utilize AWS to save models and data
- Find applicable datasources with accompanying descriptions
    - Learn how to automatically pull from these datasources
- Build models based on the datasources. Currently, I assume the overall model will be an ensemble model based on each datasource
- Connect to stock trading API to automatically create trades based on the model
- Create a UI that can track the effectiveness of my models and adjust parameters based on risk and potential new sources
